# Lba2Remake code

In future, Lba2Remake Editor may be adapted and integrated into IdaJS engine directly.
For now, here are the portions of the code that are not yet integrated, but can be used as documentation.

The original Lba2Remake project is located here: https://github.com/LBALab/lba2remake

Big thanks to the authors and contributors of Lba2Remake project for all their amazing work they've done and continue to do!

## Scene Ids

Explore SceneIds in the ts files located here. They are grouped by planets, islands and zones.

Later the scene names and ids will be included to IdaJS types directly.
