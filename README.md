# IdaJS for Little Big Adventure 2

IdaJS is a modern JavaScript scripting layer built on top of the community-maintained Little Big Adventure 2 (LBA2) engine sources. It enables creators to script gameplay, extend mechanics, and craft new stories and mods within the LBA2 world using a modern, high-level programming language.

## Related repositories

This project is a combined work, based on the following repositories:

1. [Little Big Adventure 2 - Ida Edition](https://github.com/innerbytes/lba2-classic-ida) - LBA2 engine source code, fork of the main [LBA2 Classic Community](https://github.com/LBALab/lba2-classic-community), which has necessary bug fixes to be buildable and playable on Windows 10+ systems.
 - If you do any general bug fixes to LBA2 engine or builds infrastructure in this repository, please consider contributing them back to the [this repo](https://github.com/innerbytes/lba2-classic-ida).

2. [Ida Core](https://github.com/innerbytes/ida-v8) - Core Ida engine source code, which provides V8 integration and base scripting API, which can be used as blueprint for other games as well.
  - If you do any general improvements to the Ida core engine in this repository, porting back to the Ida Core is not mandatory, but can be desirable.

## Little Big Adventure 2 - Engine source code - Community

Little Big Adventure 2 (aka Twinsen's Odyssey) is the sequel of Little Big Adventure (aka Relentless : Twinsen's Adventure) in 1997.

The LBA2 engine uses Assembly code and was originally compiled with non-open source libraries which have been excluded from the project.

The IdaJS engine was originally compiled with Google V8 libraries, that are open-source, but not GPLv2 compatible. Therefore V8 libraries have been excluded from the project.
